This dataset consists of electroencephalography (EEG) signals adquired with a low-cost consumer-grade device. The 10 participants had no previous BCI experience. The BCI protocol consisted of two conditions, namely the kinesthetic imagination of grasping movement (MI) of the dominant hand and rest/idle condition.Five protocol runs were asked to be performed by the user. The first run, called RUN0, involved real grasping  movement in order to better explain the protocol and to help the subject to focus on the sensation of making the movement.  The rest of the runs (RUN1-RUN4) were equal, consisting of MI vs.Rest conditions. The EMG signals of the dominant hand was adquired for protocol control.
